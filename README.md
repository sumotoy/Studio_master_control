# Studio_master_control
A complete studio master control for audio with mastering quality design.
This is a really big and seriously complex project I was working on by several years, I have already done at list 6 complete (and working)
prototypes because I was looking for something never made in the past. I'm working as sound engineer/musician from more than 30 years
and always looking something that can really help me in my job, of course you can spend a fortune and by tons of outboard but thanks god I'm also
an experienced electronic engineer as well so I've decided to build my own version.
Once upon a time there was a desk, many channels with one master unit where you can change volume, switch inputs and so on.
Now things get more complex, desk are almost disappeared, there's computers with hundreds of tracks, audio standars going across 44.1Khz to 192Khz (and more)
plus exotic ones (one bit with Mhz, etc.), stereo, 5.1,6.1,7.1, musicians wants many selectable channels in headphone and you have to deal with digital and analog domain.
Even worst, you have to open on the fly projects of any kind, from mastering 2 channel to a complex movie 7.1 project, all this needs
routing, speaker management and reconfiguration of outputs.
I decided to build something that can handle all this, easily, no manual routing and I'm able to save snapshots on a USB stick, all with
the state of art in therms of audio quality.
The 'thing' it's splitted in 2 main parts, the main rack where all the audio it's phisically processed and a remote connected trough a ethernet cable.
In addition there's remote satellites for musician headphone (connected with a multipolar connector) where it's possible manage headphones
 (each satellite has 6 stereo channels).
